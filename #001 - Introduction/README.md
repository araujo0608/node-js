# WHAT IS NODE JS

**It is a JavaScript interpreter that does not depend on a browser, i.e. it is completely unattached to the browser**.
Previously JavaScript could only be run in browsers, because they have JS interpreters built into their cores. NodeJS is an interpreter that is not embedded in a browser, with this it was possible to expand new horizons for JS, besides being used to make interactive pages, now we can program back-end services with it.

NodeJS works on the basis of two "engines": the **V8** and the **libuv** library
